Within the TELEVISION laboratory, I completed a project in which I had to fulfill the following requirements:
1. The total duration of the clip: exactly 3 minutes (180 seconds).
2. The format: HDV 1080p â€“ 16:9 format.
3. Inclusion of sequences from at least three distinct video files.
4. Video transitions: a minimum of five.
5. Video effects (at the sequence level): a minimum of two.
6. Picture-in-Picture (PiP) effect.
7. A logo or image with text (transparent background).
8. Playback with modified speed (for example, slow motion or fast forward).
9. Inclusion of at least two of the following advanced effects:
                                                              a) Color keying or Ultra Keying,
                                                              b) Motion tracking or camera/motion stabilization (Adobe After Effects or equivalent),
                                                              c) 3D effects (Adobe After Effects),
                                                              d)Scene blending (for adding explosions, fog, or other similar elements) using Adobe After Effects or equivalent software.
10. Use of at least one color adjustment or correction effect, such as Luma Corrector, RGB Corrector, Three-Way Color Corrector, or equivalent.
11. Text including the title of the montage, the name or names of the author or authors, the date of completion, and references for any multimedia sources used (such as audio, images, or video).
12. Audio information: the addition of a background audio track.
13. Exporting the final audio-visual sequence in H.264 format, with a resolution of 1920x1080 and a frame rate of 25 frames per second.
    
This project helped me develop my skills in filming, video editing, and montage creation.
